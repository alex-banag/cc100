* What is this?

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the homework
  (if any). The first point of call for any questions should be the
  FAQ. There are two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my courses), and a
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC 100]].
