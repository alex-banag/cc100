* What is a programming language?

  #+begin_quote
  "A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
  strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming
  languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer
  programming to implement algorithms." (Source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][Wikipedia]])

  * By-product of the UNIX operating system 1969
  * Developed on DEC PDP-7 (8K words of main memory)0
  * Written originally in assembly language
  * UNIX rewritten in C by 1973 for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11][DEC PDP-11]]
  * Standardization of C, 1973-2018

* Footnotes

[fn:4]Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two
languages in the TIOBE index (based on searches).

[fn:3]Answer: no. By 1966, there were already ca. 700 programming
languages (Chatley et al, 2019), today there are almost 9,000. C
descends from ALGOL60, other important languages are Lisp (functional
language), SIMULA (first OOP language), and PROLOG (logic language).

[fn:2]How many bits can be stored in memory of 8K words depends on the
bit length of a word (or byte). One byte holds 8 = 2^3 bits (binary
digits, or memory locations capable of storing 2 states). 8K byte
correspond to 8 * 2^10 = 8 * 1,024 = 8,192 bits. By comparison, the
main memory of my laptop is 16GB = 16 * 2^30 = 3.2E+31 bits. It
follows that UNIX (and C) had to be designed to be very small, or
space effective.
