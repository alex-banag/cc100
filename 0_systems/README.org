* Interlude: systems

  |System = a whole made up of several parts|

  | PART          | STATE 1 | STATE 2 |
  |---------------+---------+---------|
  | Boundary      | open    | closed  |
  | Elements      | inside  | outside |
  | Relationships | yes     | no      |
  | Flow          | input   | output  |

* System activities

  * Move elements
  * Add/delete elements
  * Add/delete relationships
  * Transcend boundary

* Examples for systems

  Your turn: fill in the details of these systems!

  Can you think of things that are not systems?

* TODO Ways to describe and manipulate systems


  In this section we take a look at four different ways to describe
  and manipulate systems. As an example, we use systems of financial
  markets (Sallans et al, 2003)[fn:1]. 
  
** Models/abstractions

** Stories/Narratives

** Computer algorithms

** Mathematical functions

* Summary

  * Systems are everywhere (but not everything is a system)
  * Powerful concept with many applications ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System][System sciences]]")
  * Systems have: boundaries, elements, relationships, and flow
  * Systems can be described through models or stories
  * Computers are a special case of information system
  * Attributes related to system properties are called "systemic"

[fn:1]Why this source? There is nothing special about the paper used -
  I found it while looking for a good (visual) model of financial
  markets. It is, however, interesting that the report contains all
  four ways of describing systems - as good scientific articles
  should!
