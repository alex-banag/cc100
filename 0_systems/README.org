* Prelude: systems

  |System = a whole made up of several parts|

  | PART          | STATE 1 | STATE 2 |
  |---------------+---------+---------|
  | Boundary      | open    | closed  |
  | Elements      | inside  | outside |
  | Relationships | yes     | no      |
  | Flow          | input   | output  |

* System activities

  * Move elements
  * Add/delete elements
  * Add/delete relationships
  * Transcend boundary

* Examples for systems

  Your turn: fill in the details of these systems!

  Can you think of things that are not systems?

* Ways to describe and manipulate systems

  In this section we take a look at four different ways to describe
  and manipulate systems. As an example, we use systems of financial
  markets (Sallans et al, 2003)[fn:1].

** Models/abstractions

   The model below shows a system consisting of three elements (which
   are systems themselves): a firm, a consumer market, and a financial
   market.

** Stories/Narratives

   This is the prose that explains the graphic model in more detail.

   #+begin_quote
   "The model consists of two markets: a consumer market and a
   financial equities market. The consumer market simulates the
   manufacture of a product by production firms, and the purchase of
   the product by consumers. The financial market simulates trading of
   shares. The shares are traded by financial traders. The two markets
   are coupled: The financial traders buy and sell shares in the
   production firms, and the managers of firms may be concerned with
   their share price. The traders can use the performance of a firm in
   the consumer market in order to make trading decisions. Similarly,
   the production firms can potentially use positioning in product
   space and pricing to influence the decisions of financial traders."

** Computer algorithms

   The article studies management compensation using a "discrete-time
   agent-based economic model". The agent behavior is expressed
   algorithmically as a sequence of possible actions. For example for
   the production firm, the algorithm can be expressed as shown.

** Mathematical functions

   Rational agents are designed to maximize utility functions. An
   example is the action-value or Q-function, which is "defined as the
   expected discounted return conditioned on the current state $s$ and
   action $a$" (of the agent):

* Summary

  * Systems are everywhere (but not everything is a system)
  * Powerful concept with many applications ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System][System sciences]]")
  * Systems have: boundaries, elements, relationships, and flow
  * Systems can be described through models or stories
  * Computers are a special case of information system
  * Attributes related to system properties are called "systemic"

[fn:1]Why this source? There is nothing special about the paper used -
I found it while looking for a good (visual) model of financial
markets. It is, however, interesting that the report contains all
four ways of describing systems - as good scientific articles
should!
