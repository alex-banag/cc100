* Why we don't just get coding

  There are two reasons - one is philosophical, the other is
  technical.

  #+begin_quote
  "Understanding underlying technologies helps you develop a sense of
  what can go wrong. Knowing just high-level tools makes it easy to ask
  the wrong questions. It's worth learning to use a hammer before
  graduating to a nail gun. Learning underlying systems and tools gives
  you the power to build new tools, which is important because there
  will always be a need for tool builders, even if tool users are more
  common. Learning about computers so that the behavior of programs
  isn't a mystery enables you to craft better code." (Steinhart, 2019)
  #+end_quote

  The other reason has to do with C itself:

  | TASK                                                    | SOFTWARE |
  |---------------------------------------------------------+----------|
  | C source code needs to be written and edited            | editor   |
  | C source code needs to be compiled, linked and debugged | compiler |
  | C object code needs to be run                           | shell    |

* Installing Code::Blocks

** Windows

** MacOS

** Linux

* Alternative: GNU Linux/Emacs
** What's that?

   Linux probably doesn't need an introduction. But Emacs might.

** Installation & Mastery

   Both Linux and Emacs is the beginning of a beautiful, multi-hour
   journey. I estimate that it'll take > 2 hours until you're
   reasonably competent to use either. Once you invest this time,
   you'll have a set of very valuable, marketable, transferable
   computer craft skills.

** Trends - Freedom or Slavery?

   Again, you probably know that Linux (via Android) is the trend king
   among operating systems ([[https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/linux-statistics/#gref][Galov, 2021]]).

   Below is a recent evaluation of Emacs' popularity. However,
   comparing Emacs with text editors does not make too much sense
   since Emacs is much more than a text editor, and also much more
   than an (language-specific) IDE. Watch the video for this and much
   more up to date information:
   
   "[[https://youtu.be/9ahR5K_wkNQ][M-x Forever: Why Emacs will outlast text editor trends]]"
   (Wilson, 2021).

   [[./img/trend.png]]

   /Figure: Interest in different text editors from worldwide Google
   searches 2004-2021. [[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=Emacs,%2Fm%2F0134xwrk,%2Fm%2F07zh7,%2Fm%2F0b6h18n,%2Fm%2F0_x5x3g][Source: trends.google.com]]/

   From a data science point of view, search trend data are
   problematic because it is not clear how they are collected and
   labelled, who or why is searching for something.

   The key characteristic of Emacs (besides its being firmly rooted in
   text) is its self-extensibility and large, stable, knowledgeable,
   active user community. With an estimated 27 million developers
   world-wide, 5% amounts to 1,350,000 developers who're using
   Emacs. Among professional developers, Vim/Emacs are still
   irreplaceable. IDEs (like Code::Blocks, Netbeans, Ellipse, Visual
   Studio Code) are Okay for small scripting projects and web
   applications ([[https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/09/modern-ide-vs-vim-emacs/][Biggs/Donovan, 2020]]).
