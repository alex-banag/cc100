# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In fact, the site will of course store data related to your
network location and access manner - your operating system, and many
details that could, in principle, be used to trace the download back
to you.

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> A "binary" program is a file that will run on your computer
without any extra effort. This means that the program is suited to the
specifics of the computer. The binary itself is compiled from
so-called "source code", the original, human-readable format of the
code. The binary, on the other hand, can only be read by a machine.

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> OS = Operating System - likely to be one of: Windows 10, MacOS,
or Linux. Android and iOS are also operating systems, but for mobile
devices only. See also: course CSC 420 on Operating Systems.

<sup><a id="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a></sup> This is not something to agree upon lightly. Always make sure
you know the source of the program and that you can trust it. In this
case, I downloaded the executable file from
[sourceforge.net](#org8810ab2), which is a trustworthy platform
similarly to GitHub ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge)).
