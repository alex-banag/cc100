  #+begin_quote
  "Understanding underlying technologies helps you develop a sense of
  what can go wrong. Knowing just high-level tools makes it easy to ask
  the wrong questions. It's worth learning to use a hammer before
  graduating to a nail gun. Learning underlying systems and tools gives
  you the power to build new tools, which is important because there
  will always be a need for tool builders, even if tool users are more
  common. Learning about computers so that the behavior of programs
  isn't a mystery enables you to craft better code." (Steinhart, 2019)
