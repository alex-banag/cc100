       SourceForge, etc.)
     * Built around Git by Linus Torvalds
     * Bought by Microsoft in 2018 (like OpenAI - home of GPT3)
     * 77 mio users (developers) + 200+ mio software projects
     * AI support (e.g. [[https://copilot.github.com/][GitHub Copilot]] - AI-enabled code generator)

     Watch: "[[https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E][What is GitHub?]]" (GitHub, 2016)

** Overview

   | HOW      | WHAT                                  |
   |----------+---------------------------------------|
   | Review   | [[file:~/Documents/GitHub/org/FAQ.org::Completing the GitHub "hello world" exercise][GitHub Hello World exercise]] (see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#completing-the-github-hello-world-exercise][FAQ]]) |
   | Lecture  | [[file:1_introduction/README.org::What will you learn?][Introduction to C]]                     |
   | Practice | Install C compiler ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-to-install-a-c-compiler-under-windows-and-macos][see FAQ]])          |
   |          | Set PATH environment variable         |
   |          | Test C compiler                       |

** Objectives

   * [ ] Review the basics of Git and GitHub

   * [ ] Understand what C is, and why you learn it

   * [ ] Install the GNU C and C++ compiler (~gcc~)

   * [ ] Set ~PATH~ environment variable under Windows

   * [ ] Test the C compiler

* Week 2 - Infrastructure

   * Installing a C compiler on your laptop ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-to-install-a-c-compiler-under-windows-and-macos][Info: FAQ]]).
   * GNU Emacs installation ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-to-install-emacs-ess-under-windows-and-macos][Info: FAQ]]) - you need this for an
     assignment next week.

*** Install a compiler     
*** GNU Emacs (1976...1985)

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/emacs.png]]

    * Why are we using it?
      - To mix documentation + code + output = literate programming
        (1984)
      - It's the same thing as an interactive computing notebook
        (Jupyter) ... except open to ALL languages and outputs
      - check out my [[https://youtu.be/8HJGz3IYoHI][screencast demo video]] (Birkenkrahe, 2022)

    * How are we going to use it?

    * What will you have to do?
