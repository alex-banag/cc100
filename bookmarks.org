** What is this about?

   When I find an interesting article or video, I share it here. Most
   of these are possible starting points for a short presentation, or
   may be useful for your application research.

   I usually look at the articles in some detail (though I rarely work
   through them - that would be your job), and assign a label for the
   difficulty level Lvl = 0 (simple), 1 (moderate), 2 (difficult), or 3
   (hard).

   Papers can be hard for different reason: length, technical
   vocabulary, writing style, mathematics, number of citations etc. If
   you find any of these interesting and want to use them for your
   research, you might ask me why I assigned a particular level.
