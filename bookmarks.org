** What is this about?

   When I find an interesting article or video, I share it here. Most
   of these are possible starting points for a short presentation, or
   may be useful for your application research.

   I usually look at the articles in some detail (though I rarely work
   through them - that would be your job), and assign a label for the
   difficulty level Lvl = 0 (simple), 1 (moderate), 2 (difficult), or 3
   (hard). Sites or tutorials aren't labeled by difficulty.

   Papers can be hard for different reason: length, technical
   vocabulary, writing style, mathematics, number of citations etc. If
   you find any of these interesting and want to use them for your
   research, you might ask me why I assigned a particular level.

   * Setup compilers: scan for existing compilers or install MinGW
     compiler. Download newer (stable) version if you like. Check out
     forums and wiki (both on the web).
** What is a programming language

   A lot of vocal fry [[https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/][in this video]] but you can also just read the
   transcript. Includes some good links, like [[https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html][PYPL]]. I have started the (free) C++
   course from Codeacademy (they're a big online course provider).
